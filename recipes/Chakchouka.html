   <h3>Shakshuka Chakchouka </h3>
   <p>Shakshuka (chakchouka or shakshouka) is a Tunisian dish of tomatoes, onions, pepper, spices, and eggs. It's usually eaten for breakfast or lunch, but I think it's tasty anytime. And it's easy to make. It is similar to the Turkish dish menemen and the Latin American breakfast dish huevos rancheros.</p>
   <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li> 
      <li>1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers, any color</li> 
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 Â½ cups chopped tomatoes</li>  
      <li>1 hot chile pepper, seeded and finely chopped, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h4>Step:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, bell pepper, and garlic. 
        Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</p></li>      
      
      <li><p>Meanwhile, mix together tomatoes, chile pepper, cumin, paprika, and salt in a bowl.</p></li>      
      
      <li><p>Stir tomato mixture into onion mixture. Simmer, uncovered, until tomato juices have cooked off, about 10 minutes.</p></li>     
      
      <li><p>Make 4 indentations in tomato mixture; crack eggs into indentations. Cover the skillet and cook until eggs are firm but not dry, about 5 minutes.</p></li>   
    <h4><em>Tips:</em></h4>
     <p>You may use drained canned tomatoes instead of fresh ones if desired.</p>
